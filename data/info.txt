🛒 BigBasket SmartCart – AI Assistant for BigBasket Shopping
🧾 Introduction
The rapid evolution of AI technologies has created new opportunities for enhancing user experience in digital commerce. Leveraging state-of-the-art language models and retrieval systems, intelligent assistants can now understand complex queries, process vast amounts of product data, and deliver precise, context-aware responses. This project presents a scalable and robust AI-powered shopping assistant tailored for BigBasket's product ecosystem. Built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector embeddings, and large language models (LLMs), the system enables efficient and intelligent product discovery through natural language interaction.

❗ Problem Statement
Online shoppers frequently seek personalized and context-specific product recommendations, such as identifying the best-rated skincare item at the lowest price. However, conventional search systems often fall short in understanding such nuanced queries, lacking the ability to interpret intent, compare attributes across products, and deliver concise, relevant results. This creates friction in the user journey, leading to suboptimal shopping experiences. There is a clear need for an intelligent assistant that can process natural language queries, reason over structured product data, and deliver accurate, insightful responses to aid decision-making.

Business Goal:
To enhance the shopping experience, boost conversion rates, and optimize search efficiency by enabling natural language-based product search that understands user intent and delivers context-aware, personalized recommendations.

💰 Business Impact (Revenue + Cost)
💸 1. Increased Conversion Rates (↑ Revenue)

• Users find relevant products faster, leading to more product views, cart adds, and purchases

• Personalized recommendations match buyer intent better than traditional search

• Better UX = lower drop-off rates
📈 Even a 1–2% uplift in conversions from improved product search can lead to significant revenue gains for a large marketplace like BigBasket.

📉 2. Reduced Customer Support Queries (↓ Cost)

• AI assistant can handle informational and product-related queries

• Reduces manual intervention, live chat support, and email volume

• More self-service = less operational overhead
⏱️ 3. Reduced Time-to-Purchase (↑ Efficiency)

• Customers make faster decisions because the assistant summarizes comparisons (e.g., price vs. rating trade-offs)

• This shortens the purchase journey and increases user satisfaction
🧪 4. Rapid Experimentation & Deployment (↓ Dev Costs)

• The project is modular, Dockerized, and CI/CD enabled → easier to iterate and deploy

• Can be extended to other verticals (electronics, fashion) or other marketplaces with minimal changes
🚀 Features
🔍 Natural Language Product Search Users can ask queries like "cheapest skin care with highest rating" or "best perfume under ₹500".

🧠 Query Rewriting with LLM Uses Groq LLMs (gemma2-9b-it) to refine user queries for more precise retrieval.

📄 Document Embedding & Vector Search Preprocessed BigBasket product data embedded with thenlper/gte-small and indexed using FAISS.

🤖 RAG Pipeline Uses llama3-70b-8192 model for final answer generation based on retrieved and reranked results.

🔁 Reranking with CrossEncoder Improves accuracy using cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2.

🌐 FastAPI Backend Easily accessible via localhost:8000 or deployed server.

🐳 Dockerized Build once, run anywhere. Fully containerized using Docker.

🚰 CI/CD with GitHub Actions Automated testing, image build, and push to DockerHub.

📜 Logging Logging implemented for each step in the pipeline for transparency and debugging.

1. 🛒 BigBasket SmartCart – AI Assistant for BigBasket Shopping
---
## 🧾 Introduction

The rapid evolution of AI technologies has created new opportunities for enhancing user experience in digital commerce. Leveraging state-of-the-art language models and retrieval systems, intelligent assistants can now understand complex queries, process vast amounts of product data, and deliver precise, context-aware responses. This project presents a scalable and robust AI-powered shopping assistant tailored for BigBasket's product ecosystem. Built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector embeddings, and large language models (LLMs), the system enables efficient and intelligent product discovery through natural language interaction.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Online shoppers frequently seek personalized and context-specific product recommendations, such as identifying the best-rated skincare item at the lowest price. However, conventional search systems often fall short in understanding such nuanced queries, lacking the ability to interpret intent, compare attributes across products, and deliver concise, relevant results. This creates friction in the user journey, leading to suboptimal shopping experiences. There is a clear need for an intelligent assistant that can process natural language queries, reason over structured product data, and deliver accurate, insightful responses to aid decision-making.

---

## Business Goal:

To enhance the shopping experience, boost conversion rates, and optimize search efficiency by enabling natural language-based product search that understands user intent and delivers context-aware, personalized recommendations.



## 💰 Business Impact (Revenue + Cost)

💸 1. Increased Conversion Rates (↑ Revenue)

    • Users find relevant products faster, leading to more product views, cart adds, and purchases

    • Personalized recommendations match buyer intent better than traditional search

    • Better UX = lower drop-off rates

📈 Even a 1–2% uplift in conversions from improved product search can lead to significant revenue gains for a large marketplace like BigBasket.

📉 2. Reduced Customer Support Queries (↓ Cost)

    • AI assistant can handle informational and product-related queries

    • Reduces manual intervention, live chat support, and email volume

    • More self-service = less operational overhead

⏱️ 3. Reduced Time-to-Purchase (↑ Efficiency)

    • Customers make faster decisions because the assistant summarizes comparisons (e.g., price vs. rating trade-offs)

    • This shortens the purchase journey and increases user satisfaction

🧪 4. Rapid Experimentation & Deployment (↓ Dev Costs)

    • The project is modular, Dockerized, and CI/CD enabled → easier to iterate and deploy

    • Can be extended to other verticals (electronics, fashion) or other marketplaces with minimal changes
